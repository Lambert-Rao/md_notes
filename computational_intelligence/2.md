## Introduction to Evolution Algorithm 

> EAs

### why Evolution Algorithm?

limitation of traditional optimization method 

单峰问题 traditional method select a first point, and use graduation & step to find the optimal solution (单峰问题传统算法梯度下降找最优解很好)

but with multiple modals,traditional method may find a wrong solution (陷入局部最优解)

so how about searching from different directions, we can find many solution, and find the best of them 

### what are evolution algorithms?

intelligent optimization techniques inspired by nature 

> Darwin -> genetic algorithm 
>
> birds -> particle swarm optimization 
>
> ants -> ant colony algorithms 

### framework of evolution algorithm 

we have *NP*th individual, select some of them to get a population, then elect parent set from population, crossover and mutation on parent set to get a new  solutions, do a replacement on new solutions to get a new population, then loop it until reaching the halt condition.

> just a framework

### characteristics

1. search for the optimal solution from many points rather than one.
2. choose individuals based on `fitness function`(适应值信息, 启发函数), and **do not need** the `gradient information`.
3. use the random properties transition rule rather than the deterministic transition rule.

### what is GA?

take the inspiration from Darwin 's theory of evolution, natural selection, and survival of the fittest in biological world.

basic component of GA

chromosome or string, also called individual.

> 110000101000010001 string 

schema: fix some bits, and random others

- operations:

  - selection: individuals copied according to fitness function; an artificial version of nature selection;

   > create a wheel based on the properties of fitness.
  
  - crossover
  
   > randomly select two individuals, from population; choosing a crossover site at random, enchange the site with property $p_e$.
